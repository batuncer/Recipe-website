          <p>Traditionally, bagels are not made with milk, hence vejahn. Sometimes, however, the water is replaced entirely with milk for a more brioche-like consistency. But we don't want that!</p>

            <h5>Step 1</h5>
            If you want to do it with Saui:
            <h5>Step 2</h5>
            The day before, mix 25 g starter, 50 g water and 50 g flour into the pre-dough. Mix with the water the next day, just add 2 g of yeast. Reduce the amount of flour and water from the list above accordingly.
            <h5>Step 3</h5>
            Dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water and leave to foam for 10-15 minutes at room temperature. Add flour and salt and knead into a dough until it is no longer sticky. Add a little more flour if you need it, but it should come from kneading. Cover and leave to stand for 40-60 minutes until the dough has doubled in size.
            <h5>Step 4</h5>
            Divide into 8 pieces of about the same size, shape into a ball and poke a hole in the middle. Put a chopstick or wooden spoon in the hole and swing the bagels quickly to enlarge the hole. Cover and let rise again for 20-30 minutes.
            <h5> Step 5</h5>
            Let them soak in boiling water for 2 minutes on each side and place on baking paper. Spread with Eggwash and top as desired. In the oven at 200 degrees for 20-25 minutes. 
Finished! The best bleach is simply lox & cream cheese
