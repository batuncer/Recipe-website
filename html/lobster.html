        <h1>Vegan Lobster rolls</h1>
        <p>The filling for the vegan lobster roll is easier than many would think. Most of the time we only taste the spices that are used in fish. For real. Fish is rarely eaten raw and in perfect quality. So I find it quite easy to substitute fish for such fast food dishes. You just have to get a good consistency. Old Bay Seasoning is very helpful in making seasoned tastes instantly fishy.  
          But you don't have to order a new spice - mixing it yourself or just celery salt is often sufficient.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>4 hot dog buns, cut open at the top</li>
                <li>750 g palm hearts</li>
                <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Old Bay Seasoning (or celery salt, paprika, cardamom powder, pepper, ginger powder))</li>
                <li>2 tbsp kombu dashi or vegetable broth</li>
                <li>juice of a lemon</li>
                <li>1 clove of knob, grated or pressed</li>
                <li>100gr mayo</li>
                <li>3 sticks of celery, finely diced</li>
                <li>Herbs: chives, dill, tarragon</li>
                <li>Some garlic butter</li>
                <li>optional: lettuce leaves for a bite</li>
                
            </ul></div>
        <div class="box content"><h4>Coking instructions</h4>
            <h5>Step 1</h5>
            Drain the palm hearts and cut into slices about 1-1.5 cm thick – try to leave as many as possible whole. Add the oil, half the lemon juice, dashi or broth, pack the spices and garlic, stir well and leave to marinate overnight...at least for a few hours.

            <h5>Step 2</h5>
            After the hearts of the palm are well-drained, sauté briefly - change the consistency a bit - and let cool.

            <h5>Step 3</h5>
            Mix the mayo, the chopped vegetables and the herbs together with a little lemon juice and add to the palm hearts - actually done now. Season with celery salt and pepper.

            <h5>Step 4</h5>
            Toast the buns for feeding and brush the insides with melted garlic butter. Line with lettuce leaves and fill with the lobster. Sprinkle some smoked paprika powder for the look, garnish with herbs and off you go!
