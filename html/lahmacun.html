        <h1>Lahmacun</h1>
        <p>Lahmacun is a traditional snack from Turkey - but also from parts of Armenia. Here's a relatively simple vegan version. Instead of meat substitutes, you can also use simply cooked lentils, which are seasoned in exactly the same way and pressed into a paste.</p>

            <h5>Step 1</h5>
            The basis for the lahmacun is a thin yeast dough. To do this, dissolve the yeast and sugar in a warm mixture of milk and water and leave to rise at room temperature for about 15 minutes. Then add the remaining ingredients. Knead for at least 10-15 minutes to form a smooth dough, cover and let rise in a warm place for 40-60 minutes.
            <h5>Step 2</h5>
            Meanwhile, prepare the filling: grate all the vegetables or put them through a processor and mix well with the minced meat along with the spices. It'll be a little runny at first, but the vegan mince draws in a lot of the liquid. Just let it stand for 15 minutes until the mass gets a good consistency.
            <h5>Step 3</h5>
            Divide the dough into 10 parts, form into balls and cover. Roll out the dough pieces thinly one after the other, spread thinly with the minced mixture. Bake in a coated or oiled pan with the lid on for 5-7 minutes over medium heat. If you don't have a pan with a lid, you can also use it in the oven at 200Â°. Once fried, the lahmacun is stacked like this: minced side to minced side, batter side to batter side.
            <h5>Step 4</h5>
            Top the lahmacun with the fresh lettuce, roll & scoop, I like yoghurt with it, and more cucumbers than tomatoes in the salad. But you do as you like.
